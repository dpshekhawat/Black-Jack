# Black-Jack
Black Jack game made with python

Hey geeks I have made this basic game with many classes & functions in python and while making the game I was very curious about playing it and I had put so much time and 
effort in logic building, dealing with classes and functions and loops too.

But unfortunately even after debugging the code several times there is still an error is occuring again and again, I wanted to make this game error free but I thought why
not take the help from you.

To know the error copy or clone this code and run it in your any IDE and tell me what error occured while playing and what more to be added in PR's.

I am currently trying to find the solution and what actually causing the error also, I need you also to find the solution and cause so that we can learn about handling this
type of error in future.

# About Game ~
This game is very easy to play for those who know how to play and for those who never heard about this you can see this video tutorial (https://youtu.be/-9YGKFdP6sY),
I have not added each and every rules and methods but the overall gameplay is same the player who hits 21 first loses the game or bet. For starting the player has 100 chips 
by default you can add more by changing the code.

Happy Learning!! 

(P.S. - will update this with more features soon when I will solve the error..!)
